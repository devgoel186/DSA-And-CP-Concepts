# Graphs

Graphs are basically nodes which may be connected to each other.

## Differences between graphs and trees

- All trees are connected, however graphs may or may not be connected.
- Trees don't contain cycles, however, graphs may or may not contain cycles.

## Terms and Terminologies

- Adjacent vertices = Vertices which have an edge between them.
- Degree = Number of edges connected to the particular vertex.
- Path = Connection of edges between two vertices.
- Connected graph = For any two vertices, there must be a path between them.
- Connected components = A graph which consists of connected components, which are not connected to each other, but are connected in themselves (independently).
- Tree = A connected graph which doesn't have a cycle.

Minimum number of edges in a connected graph = n - 1
Edges in a complete graph = nC2 [A complete graph is one in which all edges are connected to one another]
