# HashMaps

HashMaps can be defined in a simple manner to be key-value pairs.
HashMaps can be implemented in three ways:

- Using Linked Lists. All operations will take O(n) complexity.
- Using BST (or ordered maps). All operations take O(log n).
- Using Hash tables. All operations take O(1).

Functions in a hashmap :

- insert(K key, V value)
- getValue(K key)
- delete key(K key)
