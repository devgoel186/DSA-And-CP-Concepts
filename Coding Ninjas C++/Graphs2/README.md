## Spanning Trees

A tree which contains all the vertices of a graph, but satisfies all properties of a tree, i.e, it has no cycle, and it is connected.

**What are Minimum Spanning Trees?**

MST is defined using weighted graphs. For a tree to be MST, we construct a spanning tree with the minimum possible weight. Remember that if the no. of vertices in our graph is n, then the no. of edges in our tree is n-1.

## Kruskal's Algorithm

This algorithm helps to figure out the MST of a graph.
