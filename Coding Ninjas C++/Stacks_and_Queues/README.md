# Stacks and Queues

Implementations of codes for stacks and queues using static arrays, dynamic arrays, templates and linked list.
Examples with explanation included.

## Stacks

- Functions are push(), pop(), top(), size(), and isEmpty()
- Stacks are implemented in a LIFO manner (Last In First Out)

### Contents of Stacks

- Stacks using array
- Stacks using dynamic arrays
- Stacks using inbuilt stack
- Stacks using templates for user-defined datatype
- Stacks using linked lists and templates

## Queues

- Functions are :
  - enqueue() -> similar to push() in stack,
  - dequeue() -> similar to pop() in stack,
  - front() -> similar to top() in stack,
  - size(),
  - isEmpty()
- Stacks are implemented in a LIFO manner (Last In First Out)
